1 Executive Summary
1.1 Overview
Metronis Aegis is a comprehensive AI evaluation platform designed to ensure the safety, accu-
racy, and compliance of AI systems deployed in healthcare environments. The platform addresses
the critical challenge of validating AI-generated clinical recommendations in real-time, preventing
potentially harmful outputs from reaching clinicians and patients.

Key Value Proposition
Problem: Healthcare AI systems can produce dangerous outputs including hallucinated
medications, missed contraindications, and outdated clinical guidance.
Solution: A multi-tiered evaluation pipeline that combines fast rule-based checks, ML
classification, LLM-as-judge evaluation, and expert review to catch 95%+ of dangerous
errors while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Impact: Reduce AI-related clinical errors by 90%+, provide audit trails for regulatory
compliance, and enable continuous improvement through active learning.
1.2 Supported AI Application Types
The system is designed to evaluate four primary categories of healthcare AI applications:

Application Type Description Risk Level
Clinical Decision Support Chatbots providing treatment recommenda-
tions, medication suggestions, and clinical guid-
ance
CRITICAL
RAG Systems Retrieval-augmented systems that fetch and
synthesize clinical guidelines and evidence
HIGH
Diagnostic Aids AI systems that estimate disease likelihood and
suggest differential diagnoses
CRITICAL
Documentation Automation Clinical note generation, encounter documenta-
tion, and administrative text
MEDIUM
Table 1: Supported AI Application Types and Risk Levels
1.3 Key Design Principles
Modularity: Pluggable evaluation modules for different AI types
Scalability: Handle 100K-10M+ traces/month
HIPAA Compliance: De-identification and encryption throughout
Extensibility: Easy to add new evaluation types and domains
Cost Efficiency: Tiered evaluation minimizes expensive LLM calls
2 System Architecture Overview
2.1 High-Level Architecture
The Metronis Aegis platform follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns.
The system is designed for horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time evaluation of AI
outputs.

Scalability Note
All services are designed to be stateless and horizontally scalable. The message queue
(Kafka) enables asynchronous processing and load leveling, allowing the system to handle
traffic spikes without degradation.
2.2 Core Components
The platform consists of nine primary components, each designed for a specific purpose within the
evaluation pipeline:

Component Purpose SLA
SDK Lightweight client library for trace collection
with minimal performance impact
<10ms overhead
API Gateway Authentication, rate limiting, routing, and
load balancing
99.9% uptime
Trace Ingestion PHI de-identification, validation, and stor-
age of trace data
<100ms P
Evaluation Orchestrator Routes traces to appropriate modules based
on application type and tier results
<50ms P
Evaluation Modules Pluggable validators for different AI types
(12+ modules)
Varies by tier
Knowledge Base Service Interfaces to medical databases (RxNorm,
SNOMED CT, FDA)
<200ms cached
Active Learning Engine Uncertainty sampling and continuous model
retraining
Weekly cycles
Alert Engine Real-time notifications for critical issues via
multiple channels
<30s for critical
Dashboard Web interface for viewing results, analytics,
and trace exploration
Real-time updates
Table 2: Core System Components with Service Level Agreements
2.3 Tiered Evaluation Pipeline Architecture
The evaluation pipeline uses a four-tier approach that balances cost and accuracy. Each trace flows
through the tiers sequentially, with early-exit logic to minimize expensive operations.
Cost Efficiency Strategy
The tiered approach reduces evaluation costs by 10-50x compared to running LLM evaluation
on all traces:
 70% of tracespass Tier 1 (free) and never reach expensive tiers
 28.5% of tracesare caught by Tier 2 ML model ($0.001/trace)
 1.45% of tracesrequire LLM evaluation ($0.05/trace)
 0.05% of tracesneed expert review (training data generation)
Result: Average cost of$0.008 per trace while maintaining 95%+ accuracy on critical
errors.
3 Data Architecture
3.1 Data Flow Diagram
Understanding how data moves through the system is critical for performance optimization and
debugging. The following diagram shows the complete data lifecycle from trace collection to
evaluation results.
3.2 Unified Trace Schema
All AI applications, regardless of type, produce traces with a common structure. This unified
schema enables consistent processing across all evaluation modules while maintaining flexibility for
application-specific data.

4 Evaluation Orchestrator
4.1 Architecture
The Evaluation Orchestrator is the brain of the system. It:
Receives traces from Trace Ingestion Service
Determines which evaluation modules to apply based on application type
Coordinates the tiered evaluation pipeline
Aggregates results from multiple modules
Triggers alerts for critical issues
4.2 Module Registry
The Evaluation Orchestrator maintains a registry of evaluation modules, each designed for specific
AI application types and evaluation tiers. This modular design enables easy addition of new
validators without modifying core infrastructure.

7 Active Learning & Model Training
7.1 Active Learning Flywheel
The system’s accuracy improves continuously through a closed-loop active learning process. As
more customers use the platform and experts review traces, the evaluation models become more
accurate.
Network Effects
The active learning flywheel creates a compounding advantage:
 More customersMore diverse tracesBetter error coverage
 More labeled dataMore accurate modelsFewer false positives
 Better modelsHigher confidenceLess expert review neededLower costs
 Cross-customer learning(privacy-preserving)All customers benefit from aggre-
gate insights
This creates a moat that strengthens over time as the dataset grows.
7.2 Tier 2 ML Model Architecture

3 Input Layer:
4 - Text embeddings (768-dim from BioBERT)
5 - Entity features (medication count , diagnosis count , etc.)

7.4 Model Retraining Pipeline
1 Retraining Triggers:
2 1. 500+ new labeled examples accumulated
3 2. Weekly scheduled retraining
4 3. Model performance drops below threshold
5 4. New error pattern detected
6
7 Retraining Process:
8
9 Step 1: Data Preparation
10 - Fetch all expert reviews since last training
11 - Balance dataset (oversample rare error types)
12 - Split: 80% train , 10% val , 10% test
13
14 Step 2: Model Training
15 - Fine -tune from previous checkpoint
16 - Early stopping on validation loss
17 - Save checkpoints every epoch
18
19 Step 3: Evaluation
20 - Compute metrics on test set
21 - Compare to current production model
22 - If better: proceed to Step 4
23 - If worse: alert team , don ’t deploy
24
25 Step 4: A/B Testing
26 - Deploy to 5% of traffic (canary)
27 - Monitor for 48 hours
28 - Compare metrics to production model
29 - If metrics hold: expand to 25%
30 - If metrics improve significantly: expand to 100%
31
32 Step 5: Full Deployment
33 - Gradual rollout to all customers
34 - Monitor for regressions
35 - Keep previous model as fallback

Critical Safeguards:
 All traces are de-identifiedbeforestorage (no raw PHI in databases)
 Multiple layers of detection (Presidio AI + custom regex + manual QA)
 Re-identification mappings stored separately with additional encryption
 Audit trail for all PHI access (HIPAA§164.312(b))
 Automatic alerts for detected PHI in stored traces

15.5 Final Assessment
Buildable Scalable Defensible
This system design represents apragmatic, buildable MVPthat balances:
 Ambition: Comprehensive coverage of healthcare AI evaluation needs
 Realism: Phased approach with clear validation gates
 Modularity: Start with one AI type, expand systematically
 Defensibility: Active learning creates compounding moat over time
The modular design allows you to:
 Build for clinical decision support first
 Validate with pilot customer
 Add RAG, diagnostics, and documentation modules incrementally
 Expand to financial and legal verticals once healthcare is proven
Key Differentiator: Unlike generic LLM eval tools (Arize, Braintrust), this system has:
Healthcare-specific evaluation modules (medication validation, drug interactions)
HIPAA compliance built-in (not bolted on)
Cost-optimized tiered evaluation (10-50x cheaper than LLM-only)
Domain expertise encoded in Tier 1 rules (defensible, hard to replicate)
This is a solid foundation for building a market-leading AI evaluation platform for regulated
industries.
