## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Start with core infrastructure and work outward
- Implement comprehensive error handling at each layer
- Use test-driven development for critical components
- Focus on horizontal scalability from the beginning

### Technology Decisions
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI for high performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliability and ACID compliance
- **Queue**: Redis/Celery for simplicity, migrate to Kafka for scale
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes for scalability

### Quality Gates
- All services must have >80% test coverage
- API endpoints must handle error cases gracefully
- Database operations must be optimized for performance
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed before deployment

### Success Metrics
- Handle 1000 traces/hour in Phase 1
- <100ms P95 latency for trace ingestion
- <5s end-to-end evaluation latency
- 99.9% uptime for core services
- Zero data loss or corruption incidents
