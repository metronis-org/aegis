# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Metronis is a unified AI evaluation platform designed to ensure the safety, accuracy, and reliability of AI systems across all domains. The MVP focuses on building a generic evaluation infrastructure that can assess AI outputs through a cost-efficient, multi-tiered pipeline combining rule-based checks, ML classification, and LLM-as-judge evaluation.

The platform addresses the critical challenge of validating AI-generated outputs in real-time, preventing potentially harmful or incorrect outputs from reaching end users. The system is designed to be modular, scalable (100K-10M+ traces/month), and extensible to support domain-specific evaluations in future phases.

## Requirements

4. IF a trace is valid THEN the system SHALL store it in the database and queue it for evaluation
5. WHEN traces are ingested THEN the system SHALL support a unified trace schema that works across different AI application types
6. WHEN the ingestion service receives traces THEN it SHALL handle at least 1000 traces per second

### Requirement 2: Multi-Tiered Evaluation Pipeline

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to evaluate AI traces through a cost-efficient tiered pipeline, so that I can maintain high accuracy while minimizing evaluation costs.
